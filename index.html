    <p>
        My name is Gabriel Vincent C. Dela Cerna and I’m 22 years old, living in Cebu City. I have nine siblings, and I am the youngest of all.
        <br>
        In my younger years, I studied at Alaska Elementary School and graduated in batch 2012-2013. I attended Alaska Night High School, batch 2021-2022, and Junior High School at Academia Global System Colleges, batch 2024-2025. Currently, I am studying at the University of Cebu.
        <br><br>
        My hobbies include playing mobile games, using the computer, watching movies, and reading manga. I also love traveling to different places with my family and friends.
        <br><br>
        I chose to pursue a degree in BSIT because it offers practical and hands-on learning that prepares students for the real-world demands of the IT industry. The program focuses on skills in high demand today, such as programming, networking, database management, and cybersecurity. These are areas I’m very interested in, and I know that mastering them will open doors to many career opportunities. I want a degree that will not only educate me but also give me an edge in the job market.
